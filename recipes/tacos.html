            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                <em>The best tacos!</em> A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, then wrapped around a hard shell taco, which is filled with seasoned ground 
                beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and fresh guacamole. You can top it with whatever you like, but I recommend 
                loading it up! Also, if you don't eat meat, put melted cheese on the soft shell, and the refried beans in the hard.

                    <li>2 avocados</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
                    <li>1 fresh lime, juiced</li>
                    <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>12 (7 inch) flour tortillas</li>
                    <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
                    <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
                    <li>¼ red onion, chopped</li>

                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning over the meat. Cook and stir 
                        the ground beef, breaking it up as it cooks, until the beef is browned and crumbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan, and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning packet. Heat the refried beans 
                        over low heat until simmering.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the preheated oven for 3 
                        to 5 minutes.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime juice, and salt and pepper 
                        to taste, and set aside.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2 tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla gently around a crisp 
                        tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground beef along the bottom of the crisp shell, and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of shredded 
                        Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the cheese with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion, and a dollop of sour cream 
                        and guacamole.<br><br>
