        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
             This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make 
             sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high 
             heat, so <em>make sure you have everything ready to go</em>!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 hamburger buns<br><br></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed<br><br></li>
            <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)<br><br></li>
            <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper<br><br></li>
            <li>salt to taste<br><br></li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese<br><br></li>
            <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the 
                grill and preheat until smoking.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place 
                each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a 
                second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage 
                as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.<br><br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, 
                gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain 
                patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.<br><br>
            </li>
        </ol>
