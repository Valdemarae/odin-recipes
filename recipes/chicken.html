                    <li>1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper</li>
                    <li>½ cup water</li>
                    <li>½ red onion, cut into small chunks</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons sea salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are 
                        softened, 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil 
                        and blend until marinade is smooth.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet 
                        to a 1/2-inch thickness.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times to coat. Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for 
                        at least 8 hours.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An 
                        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.
